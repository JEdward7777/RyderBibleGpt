We take copyright seriously (see our [policy](https://frontierrnd.com/policy)). Please help us identify specific infringements so we can improve our systems and translations.

## Specific offending verses and wordings

Please use verse references (e.g., Genesis 1:1) or ranges (Genesis 1:1-4) to identify passages that you believe infringe an existing copyright claim.

If possible, please copy and paste the entire content into this issue, along with the specific, relevant wordings from the text under copyright (ensure you do not break fair use by inserting too much content here).

## Details of the infringed text

Please add any metadata you can share about the infringed text so that we can identify it accurately. Helpful details include:

- Text name
- Publisher
- Copyright holder (if different from publisher)
- Publication year(s) (note reprints/multiple publishers)
- Country/jurisdiction of publication

We will attempt to resolve all concerns in a speedy manner. 

Thank you for your help!
